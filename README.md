LEAD DEVELOPER                                                                                          2009 - PRESENT 

<strong>SKILLS and TOOLS:</strong> WordPress, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Blender, Unity.

<ul>
<li><strong>2009 - 2011 </strong>- I was responsible to create a database using PHP and MySQL that would help 32 Hertz musicians book shows. Musicians could log in, add or remove clubs, call clubs, comment about what the club owner said, specify a time to call back (the system would alert the musician at the right time), and keep track of all shows that are booked. I also designed the websites for the musicians, and did the social media (at this time was mostly MySpace).</li>

<li><strong>2011 - 2013</strong> - 32 Hertz wanted to put music into video games and music videos. I built many games using the Game Maker Engine as well as Java. We created animated music videos using the same software. During this time I also continued to create and maintain websites for the musicians as well as build social media presence which by now had grown to include Facebook as well as many musician websites like Reverbnation, Soundcloud, and Bandcamp.</li> 

<li><strong>2013 - 2015</strong> - 32 Hertz continued to create video games and music videos to promote music. We began to use Flash, the HTML5 Canvas, and BabylonJS to create video games. We used Blender to create 3d models and music videos. I created the first version of the 32hertz.com website during this time as well as continued to create and maintain websites for musicians. Social media also grew to include Twitter.</li>

<li><strong>2015 - 2017 </strong>- 32 Hertz wrote a book for musicians and I was responsible for creating the landing page for the book as well as an opt - in webpage for users to subscribe to a newsletter (which I created). This caused me to gain experience in copywriting, pay per click, keywords, A/B testing, Affiliate sales, etc. I also created getmysongreviewed.com which uses PHP and MySQL to create a website that allows users to log in, manage a profile page, upload songs, listen to and review other users songs, and reviews of the users own songs are saved and displayed. I have also created several different versions of the 32 Hertz Productions website and their blog. Recently we have also begun to create games using Unity, and Unreal Engine.</li>
